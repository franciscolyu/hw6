# Fibonacci Function in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This project provides a simple function to compute the sequence for a given number of terms.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

2. Import the fibonacci function into your Python script or use it interactively:
   from fibonacci import fibonacci

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

3. Run the function with any positive integer to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
